<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p>
<p>After completing this tutorial you should be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>analyze earth’s global temperatures to determine if they are increasing</li>
<li>analyze CO<sub>2</sub> data to determine if atmospheric levels are increasing</li>
<li>compare rates of increase of CO<sub>2</sub> and global temperature</li>
<li>compare current trends of with rates of change during pre-historic periods using ice core data</li>
<li>interpret results to understand current climate change</li>
</ul>
<p>Download the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/100Zbhu8l_euEA9lyKWXtcfMhhQpn8vWb?usp=sharing">03_ClimateChange</a> project folder. Once you have downloaded it, unzip the project directory into your <code>BI449</code> directory. You can open the <code>Rproj</code> for this module either by double clicking on it which will launch <code>Rstudio</code> or by opening <code>Rstudio</code> and then using <code>File &gt; Open Project</code> or by clicking on the <code>Rproject</code> icon in the top right of your program window and selecting <code>Open Project</code>.</p>
<p>Once you have opened a project you should see the project name in the top right corner<label for="tufte-sn-52" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">52</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-52" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">52</span> Pro tip: If you run into issues where an Rmarkdown won’t render or file paths aren’t working (especially if things were working previously) one of your first steps should be to double check that the correct <code>Rproj</code> is loaded.</span>.</p>
<p>You should have a <code>ClimChange.Rmd</code> in your project directory. Use that file to work through this set of activities - you will hand in your rendered (“knitted”) rmarkdown file as your homework assignment.</p>
<p>You will use this <code>Rmarkdown</code> file to record your answers. So, per usual, first thing in the <code>YAML</code> header, change the author to your name. Remember to use comments to describe your code; at minimum you should have one comment per code set<label for="tufte-sn-53" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">53</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-53" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">53</span> You should do this even if you are adding code yourself or if you are using code from our manual, even if it isn’t commented in the manual … you may of course add as many comments as you need to be able to recall what you did</span>. Now that you have gained additional <code>Rmarkdown</code> skills use those to format your “report” that you will hand in. Code chunks should have comments, add answers to questions in plain text (not as code in chunks), use headers intentionally, and of course you have options like bullet points etc. as well.</p>
<p>Global change biology/ecology is an emerging field of research that is focused how changes in temperature and precipitation resulting from anthropogenic climate change will in turn alter the distribution, abundance, behavior, and physiology of on individual species, populations, communities, and ecosystems. In recent years, modeling has become increasingly sophisticated. Additionally, long-term and large-scale data sets are becoming increasingly available. This allows us to not only investigate impacts that can be observed now but also predict how different scenarios of global change will impact the biosphere. Typical lines of investigation include range shifts and invasions, how communities can be altered and the formation of new ones, impacts of urbanization, wildfires, and other natural catastrophes, loss of biodiversity, and changes in phenology along with understanding mechanisms of species/ecosystem resilience, and the interplay of biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. Many problems have both a temporal and spatial aspect making them especially complex and difficult to model.</p>
<p>During this unit we will start by taking a look at past and present rates of change of global temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Then we will take a look at some additional data sets to sharpen our visualization skills.</p>
<p>Let’s start by loading the packages we will need for this tutorial.</p>

<p>Climate regimes are defined by patterns of temperature and precipitation. Global temperature is a function of how much energy the earth receives and stores which in turn is influenced by three major factors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The amount of energy received from the sun.</li>
<li>Reflection of energy by earth’s surface.</li>
<li>Atmospheric composition (greenhouse gas effect).</li>
</ol>
<p>The most recent <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/">IPCC Asessement</a> has made two very clear statements regarding climate change:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Climate change “unequivocally” caused by humans.</li>
<li>The impact of anthropogenic climate change is “unprecedented.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on their assessment of studies having looked at global warming and climate change to date, the global mean warming is estimated at 1.1°C compared to the pre-industrial record. Additionally, under every emission scenario and average warming of 1.5 °C is likely to be reached in in next 20 years. Finally, some effects such as melting glaciers, ice sheets and the permafrost have been deemed irreversible.</p>
<p>Current climate change is concerning not (only) because of absolute warmth of the earth but due to rate at which it is occurring. What this means is that over the history of our planet there have been times at which temperatures have been higher but what is “unprecedented” is the <strong>rate</strong> of increase and impact that is having on our planet<label for="tufte-sn-54" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">54</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-54" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">54</span> We will look at examples of that impact using various case studies.</span></p>
<p>The reason why the IPCC describes current climate change as <strong>anthropogenic</strong> is that increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 are driving the rapid increase in temperatures. Earth absorbs incoming solar radiation at its surface and emits long-wave radiation to maintain the energy balance at the surface. Only as small portion of that emitted radiation goes directly into space, most of it is absorbed by greenhouse gases (e.g. CO2) in the atmosphere. For the atmosphere to maintain its energy balance it emits radiation to space and back to earth. With increasing concentrations of GHG, the atmosphere absorbs and re-emits increasingly more energy. This creates an imbalance at earth’s surface and as a response earth continues to emit more energy to re-balance the budget and as a result global temperatures increase.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/energy_balance.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption">The atmospheric energy budget source: weather.gov</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Before we get started let’s consider what data sets we need to investigate whether rates of temperature increase are indeed “unprecedented,” to identify patterns of atmospheric CO2 concentrations consistent with anthropogenically driven climate change, and what we would expect our results to look like if the IPCC assessment is indeed correct in their claims.</p>
<ul>
<li>what variables/measurements do we need?</li>
<li>what comparisons do we need to be able to make to determine if the rate of temperature increase is unprecedented?</li>
<li>what would patterns consistent with anthropogenically driven climate change look like?</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need to consider limitations of our approach. In this case, we will need to consider whether our approach is investigating a causal or mechanistic effect in and of itself or if we are uncovering evidence consistent with a known mechanism/process.</p>

<div class="question-body">
<p>Sketch out what the patterns of air temperature over time would look like if the (A) earth is warming, (B) cooling, (C) not changing at all and discuss with your class mates. Determine what variables you would plot on the x-axis, y-axis and what the slope would look like.</p>
<p>You do not need to include the sketches but practice describing figures with a 1-2 sentence description of what each scenario would look like.</p>

<p>The air temperature data we will be using is compiled by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA) and can be accessed in <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/.">on their webpage</a> which also describes how their data set was compiled and processed. Scroll down the page
to the section <code>Tables of Global and Hemispheric Monthly Means and Zonal Annual Means</code> and download the <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/GLB.Ts+dSST.csv"><code>CSV</code></a> version of the <code>Global-mean monthly seasonal, and annual means</code>.</p>

<p>Before we move on, let’s check our <code>temperature</code> object in the <code>Global Environment</code> to see if the file read in okay - spoiler alert, it did not<label for="tufte-sn-55" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">55</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-55" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">55</span> You should create a habit of always checking that your data has read in as expected, immediately determining that something is wrong and correcting it will minimize issues with troubleshooting down the line.</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting Skills</strong>: Your file didn’t read in correctly. Let’s figure out why.</p>

<div id="sol-body-24" class="solution-body" style="display: none;">
<p>A good starting point is to open the file in a text editor to see if we missed anything. Sure enough there seems to be an additional line at the beginning which is probably causing the issue. One way to fix this is to simply delete the extra line … but if we want to have a reproducible workflow we want to avoid manually editing our data sets.</p>

<p>This figure gives us a qualitative view of changing global temperatures. To quantitatively assess the rate of change, we can fit a linear regression as <code>y = mx + b</code>. With <code>m</code> as the slope and <code>b</code> as the intercept to determine the rate of change.</p>
<p>For this example you would define the rate of change as the change in temperature divided by the change in time for a certain time period. A more general definition would be that you are calculating the <strong>slope</strong> of the line you have fit through the data as the change-in-y divided by the change-in-x<label for="tufte-sn-57" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">57</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-57" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">57</span> If you compare the two figures you should see that fitting a linear regression is an oversimplification but it will allow us to make a quantitative comparison</span>.</p>

<p>The most recent IPCC assessment has labeled the increase in temperatures driving contemporary climate change as “unprecedented.” However, temperatures have changed in earth’s past, and temperatures have even been higher than what we are experiencing now. What is unprecedented is the rate at which this is occurring.</p>
<p>Shall we investigate?</p>
<p>To do this we will need to look at past climate change. The two data sets we just took a look at are measurements of temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> using instrumentation, i.e. we have directly measured values for the parameters we are interested in at different points in time. Dr. Keeling was one of the first scientists to consider the importance of long-term monitoring sites. The rapid changes taking place in our environment have created a push to generate long-term data sets with a focus on making the accessible. We will take a look at some of these data sets later in this semester and you will likely use at least one of them for your own data science project.</p>
<p>However, we frequently have questions that might extend beyond data sets like the two we used above.</p>
<p>How can we access data from before we had instrumentation? One way to do this we have to use so-called <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/news/what-are-proxy-data">proxy data sets</a>.</p>

► Question 13.17
</p>
<div class="question-body">
<p>
In general, a proxy is an intermidary or subsistute, i.e. it is a parameter that can be used to represent the value of something in a calculation. Paleoclimatologist use preserved physical characteristics of the environment to stand in for direct measurements using instruments, typical examples would be ice cores, tree rings, ocean sediments, or fossil pollen. Briefly discuss the pros and cons of proxy data compared to direct measurements using specialized intruments.

<p>For a deep dive on proxy data sets and climate archives, you can check out <a href="https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/how-proxy-data-reveals-climate-of-earths-distant-past/">a detailed interactive brief on proxy data</a>.</p>
<p>For our current assessment we are going to explore proxy data derived from ice cores which next to ocean sediments give us some of the longest records of past climate conditions.</p>
<p>Hundreds of ice cores extracted from polar ice have proven valuable to understanding changes in atmospheric chemistry over pre-historic time. Here, we can make use of the fact that as the ice is formed, air bubbles are trapped. Because these air bubbles have remained frozen, they still have the same composition of gases as at the time they were trapped. The depth of an ice core is correlated to time, deeper ice is older. In other words, ice cores form an archive of atmospheric conditions over time. We can directly measure CO<sub>2</sub> from the air bubbles trapped in the ice and we can measure isotopic ratios of oxygen in the water molecules of the core to derive temperature.</p>
<p>Vostok Ice core data set has been constructed using ice cores from the Vostock research station in the Antarctica and can be access through the <a href="https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/portals/CDIAC">Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s start by taking a look at the temperature data. Use the code below to download the data and read it into R as a data frame<label for="tufte-sn-59" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">59</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-59" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">59</span> We are using a slightly different method from before which allows us to directly download the data into our data folder. We are also using <code>read_table2()</code> from the <code>readr</code> package due to the fact that our text file is formatted using neither white space nor tabs.</span>.</p>

<p>Before we move at looking at rates of change, we first need to determine how to properly read this plot. Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean that time (on the x-axis) is represented as “thousand years ago” or “time before present?” How does this differ from the other time series we have plotted today?</li>
<li>Temperature is being measured by proxy by looking at differences in isotope ratios; the data file lists this information as “Temperature variation.” What does 0C mean on this plot?</li>
<li>Consider how long glacial and interglacial periods typically last - are we currently in a glacial or interglacial period?</li>
<li>In what parts of the figure is temperature increasing/decreasing (consider slope)?</li>

<p>Now it’s time to put everything together. You might want to refer back to the beginning of this chapter when we looked at some background information about the IPCC report, the atmospheric energy budget, formulated our central questions, thought about what data sets when can use to answer our question, and the limitations of our approach.</p>
<div id="ques:cch-23" class="question">
<p class="question-begin">
► Question 13.23
</p>
<div class="question-body">
<p>Before we summarize and then interpret our results, let’s re-orient ourselves to what we’ve done with this analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write out the central question(s) we are asking.</li>
<li>List the data sets you used to investigate and what metric you calculated for each.</li>
</ul>
<p class="question-end">
<span class="fa fa-square-o solution-icon"></span>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Well-written papers frequently end their introduction section with a paragraph that summarizes what their study is investigating and how they are investigating that (set of) questions - it forms a “bridge” between the introduction that sets up relevant background information (why is my question important?) and the methods section which is a very detailed account of how data was acquired (experimental design), processed, and analyzed.</p>
<p>If you read several of these paragraphs you will realize that they all contain a statement that follows a general formula along these lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this study, we investigated [CENTRAL QUESTION OR HYPOTHESIS]. To do this we used [DESCRIPTION OF THE TYPE OF DATA SET GENERATED] to [METRICS THAT WERE CALCULATED].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should always be able to make a 2-3 sentence statement summarizing what you are investigating and how you did it, it’s a good self-check that you know what you’re trying to accomplish.</p>
<div id="ques:cch-24" class="question">
<p class="question-begin">
► Question 13.24
</p>
<div class="question-body">
<p>
Use your results to compare current changes over the last approx. 200 years in atmospheric and CO2 concentrations and global temperature to pre-historic changes.

<p><em>Be strategic in how you structure your answer to put together all the parts of our analysis. For example, start with temperature and compare the rate of change you calculate for recent times to the rate of change you calculated during the more distant past (glacials/interglacials)<label for="tufte-sn-61" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">61</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-61" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">61</span>  Remember to include units!</span>. In include your own rate of change + the answers your classmates posted in the slack channel. Then make a statement about whether or not we are currently observing an “unprecedent” change. Then do the same for CO2 concentrations. At this point you are just summarizing and describing your results, you can make clear statements of whether or not rates are positive/negative (your variables are increasing/decreasing), and whether you see the same/opposite trends but you should not yet interpret what those results mean. This would be equivalent to the results section of a lab report or research paper.</em></p>
<div id="ques:cch-25" class="question">
<p class="question-begin">
► Question 13.25
</p>
<div class="question-body">
<p>
Interpret your results to assess whether recent changes in temperature are due to natural vs anthropogenic factors. For your answer consider both arguments that attribute the change to anthropogenic factors and natural fluctuations.

<span class="fa fa-square-o solution-icon"></span>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>Now you are entering the interpretation/discussion component of your analysis. At this point your now what your key results are and you need to figure out what they mean; essentially you are finally getting around to answering those key questions you asked before designing your experiment/study. You are going to use your results as evidence for/support of your conclusion. This means that you need to demonstrate that your results are consistent with your conclusion. You also want to consider alternative explanations, limitations of your data etc. Of course, ideally you can exclude those based on e.g. evidence from other studies/data sets.</em></p>
